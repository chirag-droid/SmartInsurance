      "question1": "How are premiums paid and claims processed?",
      "answer1": "Premiums are paid directly through the platform using cryptocurrency or fiat payments. Once a claim is triggered and validated, the payout is automatically released by the smart contract to the insured partyâ€™s wallet without the need for manual approval.",
      "question2": "What kind of insurance policies can be offered on this platform?",
      "answer2": "The platform can support various insurance types, including health, travel, property, vehicle, and parametric insurance, among others. The flexibility of smart contracts allows for customized policies tailored to specific needs.",
      "question3": "How secure is the data on this platform?",
      "answer3": "All data and transactions are stored on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and protection against unauthorized changes. Additionally, cryptographic techniques are used to safeguard sensitive information.",
      "question4": "How do you ensure fairness and accuracy in claims?",
      "answer4": "Smart contracts are programmed with transparent and predefined rules that automatically verify the validity of claims based on objective data sources (e.g., weather APIs for natural disaster insurance). This minimizes disputes and ensures that only legitimate claims are paid."
